%es werden nicht biosensors kombiniert
Biocomputing has recently gained a place beneath other computing paradigms. Utilizing the natural rules of interaction between biochemical substances mimicking conventional computer systems, new ways and techniques of solving computing problems have been developed. This review covers the concept of biosensors, devices that !!!!!!, based on enzyme logic networks, that can process multiple biochemical inputs. This concept of utilizing enzymes as the ''machinery'' of biochemical logic networks, aims to create complex analytical biosensors for medical application.

\subsection{Context}

	In the medical field biosensors (analytic devices to convert a biochemical response into an electric signal) are an essential tool for the monitoring and detection of a wide range of medical conditions. The currently available sensors work as single-input devices, that can analyse only one specific substance. New concepts aim to create devices, that can analyse multiple inputs and transform those into a single output signal. This change allows for more possible applications.\\
	
	Once realized, those biosensors could revolutionize a great number medical treatments and therapies. Through the analysis of multiple inputs, the sensors could scan specific injuries or diseases. More complex models could even create sense-act-treat devices, that immediately apply the correct treatment after a specific result of the analysis. Especially in medical emergencies, where rapid reactions are of paramount importance, these developments would mark a ground-breaking change. Even personalized medical treatment, which could autonomously adjust the treatment tailored to a patient’s needs, is imaginable.\\
	
	
	The basic principle of biosensors are two layers: the receptor, that processes the inputs and the transducer, that translates the received signals to a yes/no-output. The main innovation of the new concept is to replace the current one-input receptor with a biochemical system, that allows a re-creatable analysis of multiple inputs, which are then transformed into one binary output. The logic system, consisting of enzyme-based logic gates mimicking Boolean operations, can process biochemical information.
	 
	 As the result of that reaction is reliable by definition, it produces an exploitable substance, that gets transduced into a yes/no signal.
	

	This document is structures as follows. In Section 2 the concept of Biosensors with enzyme-based logic is introduced. Subsection 2.1 describes the principle of enzyme-based gates and Subsection 2.2 networks of logic gates and the combination with transducers. While section 2 only dealy with the concept of Biosensors section 3 concentrates on the designing of multisignal Biosensors for medical applications.
	In section 4 considerations. Section 5 summarize and outlook. 
	
	
	
	
	
\section{concept}

The multisignal processing biosensors in this article are based on enzyme-based logic systems, consisting of chemical logic gates mimicking Boolean operations. Like in common biosensors with single inputs the biosensor is composed by several layers. The receptor that analyses the selected analyte of interest in common biosensors, is replaced by an enzyme logic system.
The transducer, converting biochemical interaction results into a type of signal that is oberservable, for example an electrical current. It senses physical changes and converts those into an electrical signal to represent a yes/no response.
MISSING BIOCHEMICHAL SUBSTANCES

\subsection{Enzyme-based logic gates and networks}	
	\subsubsection{Logic gate}	
		In biocomputing, enzymes as logic gate constituents in combination with chemical inputs to create an always-the-same end product is used to mimick Boolean logic gates such as AND and OR. To digitalize chemical processes, two levels of concentrations of chemical reaction materials are considered as input signals. 0 is usually considered as the absence of a enzyme, but it can be altered. 1 equals a  significantly difference to the absence or the as 0 defined concentration.
		The result is a certain substance that acts as an output signal. If it is measurable, it signals the value 1, if not, it signals value 0.
	(Katz) \\
	
		Beispiel AND 
		In Fig 1 the enzymes glucose oxidase (short Gox. It catalyses the oxidation of glucose to hydrogen peroxide and D-glucono-δ-lactone and is often used for analysing free sugar in blood) and catalase (catalyzes the decomposition of hydrogen peroxide to water and oxygen) operate as the logic gate machinery. The two input signals are H2O2 (Hydrogen peroxide) and glucose (blood sugar). When both substrates are present the inputs react and produce gluconic acid, which results in an optical absorbance change, that was defined as the ouput signal of the enzyme logic gate. The optical absorbance change just appeared in the presence of both inputs, mimicking the Boolean operation AND.

	\subsubsection{networks with electrochemical transduction}
		By assembling these single logic gates, mimicking Boolean operations,it is possible to create small logic networks (e.g. half-adder/ half subtractor)/enzyme logic systems!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!. By adding a transducer, it is possible to convert the physical change into an electric signal.
	
		Figure 1: A combination of different enzym-based logic gates, functioning as AND or OR. The cascade of reactions, when all four input chemicals are present, results in ph changes. Ph measures the degree to which a solution is acidic or alkaline. The scale is defined from 0 (acid solution) to 14 (lye solution).
		The logic network is composed of four concatenated logic gates. Those gates contain the enzymes alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH, disassembling toxic alcohols), glucose dehydrogenase( catalyst for the oxidation of glucose) and glucose oxidase act as logic gates the four specific different input signals NADH (resulting through reduction from Nicotinamid-Adenin-Dinukleotid NAD, which is a coenzyme found in all living cells),  actealdehyde (also named ethanal, which is an organic chemical compound, for example naturally occuring in coffee, bread, and ripe fruit), glucose and oxygen (O).
	 	When all inputs are present the reaction yields to an acid medium, lowering the original pH value of the solution from initial 6-7 to approximately 4.

	%verbindung mit transducer
	
		The lower pH value resulted in switching to ON of an electrochemical interface that functioned as a transducer which makes the electrical signal readable (with low voltage as the 0-value and a defined higher voltage as 1). While 16 different combinations of input signals were possible (being present or absent) only four of those resulted in an ON state.
		\begin{figure}[H] \centering \includegraphics[scale= 0.4]{pics/ph.png} \caption{Network diagramm} \label{img:ph} \end{figure}
	
	
		This combination is an example for a multisignal processing enzyme logic system coupled with an electrochemical transduction readout of the output signal (with pH change).



\section{designing for biomedical analytic applications}
	To recognize various medical relevant conditions, it is necessary to use characteristic biomarkers as inputs for the biochemical logic system. 
	For example for recognition of various injury related physiological conditions. The concentration of some biochemical substances changes in a body, typical for distinct pathological conditions.

\section{considerations} 
Being only a concept yet, there are plenty of challenges, that must be solved until a successful realization of complex applicable biosensors. The most current are as follows.
\subsubsection{Surface confinement}	In recent research, the success of enzymatic reactions was growingly dependant on the immobilization of the reagent layer. Early experiments with enzyme logic dissolved the gate constituents and chosen inputs in a solution. With the aim of complex networks that require multiple different gate constituents and inputs, each section needs to be differentiated and isolated, to prevent cross-reactions. To achieve multiple and “stackable” logic gates, the biocomputing layer needs to be immobilized. Agglomerations of multiple logic systems also induce further challenges. All reacting components need to be carefully evaluated to prevent cross-reactions, while the outside coating of the device must simultaneously protect the reagents within the device but be permeable to the desired inputs. The impact of an immobilization on the performance of biosensing devices has yet to be examined.\\

\subsubsection{Optimal transduction}	More complex setups require better and more versatile transducers. With the universal goal of processing an arbitrary number of inputs into only one output signal, the development of versatile transducers becomes crucial. WHAT The transducer must be able to process multiple logic-gate results and yet translate those into one (optical or electrical) output signal. Current research had to apply variant transducing strategies for complex devices, but aims to develop a multipurpose transducer, which can be generally utilized.\\

\subsubsection{Defining the Boolean 0- and 1-values} In the biochemical logic system as well as for the transductiors, there has to be a defined 0 and a respectively defined 1 value. 0 should mark the biological standard value, while the state of the art is to define it as the absence of signals(!!!!!), 1 the critical value. The definition of the 1-value is also problematic. In research, the 1 value has mostly been defined as a random convenient value, instead of using applicable medically critical values. Within the same field, the difference between a relevant 0 and a relevant 1 can be minimal. This leads to difficulties with the transduction. An offered solution would be a sigmoidal signal translation rather than the usual linear, to emphasise the difference an allow more reliable reading.
Scalability		One central aim of research is to achieve a maximal flexibility of sensors. In the end, it is highly expected to be able to scale every parameter of the sensor, from the complexity of the logic system to the specificity of the transducer. The aim is, to potentially combine any given number of logic gates into networks, that create more and more complex logic systems and respectively allow new applications.

\subsubsection{Relevant inputs}	A majority of laboratory projects worked with biomedical irrelevant substances for their proof of concept. A crucial step is to make the concept work with relevant inputs. In recent studies, scientists realized networks with biomedically relevant substances as inputs. The used logic networks yet did not depict a senseful logic context to the substances(WHAT). Thus not only the work with relevant substances needs to be developed further, but also the logic networks need to be adjusted to depict relevant ???\\

\subsubsection{Challenges of drug delivery}	One slightly more distant concern is the functionality of drug delivery devices. One of the key goals of research is to develop autonomous devices, that analyse certain physiological parameters and offer an immediate reaction. Experiments have shown a need for different methods and technology to distribute the correct treatment within the cycle of those devices.
