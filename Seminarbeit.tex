Biocomputing has recently gained a place beneath other computing paradigms. Utilizing the natural rules of interaction between biochemical substances, new ways and techniques of solving computing problems have been developed. This review covers the concept of combining so called biosensors, devices that analyse single-input bioprocesses, with the technical possibilities of more complex biochemical logic systems. This combination, utilizing enzymes as the ''machinery'' of biochemical logic systems, aims to create complex analytical biosensors for medical application.

\subsection{Context}
s
	In the medical field biosensors (analytic devices to convert a biochemical response into an electric signal) are an essential tool for the monitoring and detection of a wide range of medical conditions. The currently available sensors work as single-input devices, that can analyse only one specific substance. New concepts aim to create simple devices, that can analyse multiple inputs and transform those into a single output signal. This change allows for more possible applications.\\
	Once realized, those biosensors could revolutionize a great number medical treatments and therapies. Through the analysis of multiple inputs, the sensors could scan specific injuries or diseases. More complex models could even create sense-act-treat devices, that immediately apply the correct treatment after a specific result of the analysis. Especially in medical emergencies, where rapid reactions are of paramount importance, these developments would mark a ground-breaking change. Even personalized medical treatment, which could autonomously adjust the treatment tailored to a patient’s needs, is imaginable.

	While common biosensing devices are limited to a single input, the novelty of Biosensors based on enzyme-based logic systems can process muliple biochemical signals. This article concentrates on the concept of the mulisignal processing Biosensors and the resulting challenges.\\
	
	Profound impact\\
	
	Through processing automatically several biochemical inputs(physiological information), it can provide a rapid and reliable assessment of overall physiological conditions. This can help a optimal timley therapeutic intervention. They will realize sense/delivery feedback loops by coupling signal processing with chemical actuators to revolutionize patient monitoring and drug delivery. 
	
	In the Biosensors processing multiple biochemical signal, the core idea is to add a biocomputing layer that produces a final output in form of a yes/no response. Kapitel 1.2\\

\section{concept}

The multisignal processing biosensors in this article are based on enzyme-based logic systems, consisting of chemical logic gates mimicking Boolean operations. Like in common biosensors with single inputs the biosensor is composed by several layers. The receptor, that in common biosensors recognices the selected analyte of interest, is replaced by a enzyme logic systems
The transducer converting biological recognition interaction into a type of signal that is oberservable, for example a electrical current.wortähnlichkeit senses physical changes and converts it into an electrical signal

\subsection{Enzyme-based logic gates and networks}
	
	\subsubsection{Logic gate}
	
	In Biocomputing enzyme as logic in combination with chemical inputs resulting in a end product is used to mimick Boolean logic gates such as AND and OR. To digitalize chemical processes two levels of concentrations of chemical reaction materials are considers as input signals. 0 is usually considered as the absence of a enzyme, but it can be altered. 1 equals a  significantly difference to the absence or the as 0 defined concentration.
	Output signal ein vorher bestimmter stoff, falls dieser vorhanden regel 1 falls nicth regel 0.  
	(Katz) \\
	
	Beispiel AND 
	In Fig 1 glucose oxidase and catalase, which are enzymes, operate as the logic gate machinery. The two input signals H2O2 and glucose. When both substrates present the inputs reacted and produces gluconic acid, which results in anoptical absorbance change, that was defined as the ouput signal of the enzyme logic gate. The optical absorbance change just appeared in the presence of both inputs, mimicking the Boolean operation AND.

	\subsubsection{networks with electrochemical transduction}
	By assembling these single logic gates, mimicking Boolean operations,it is possible to create small logic networks(e.g. half-adder/ half subtractor)/enzyme logic systems. Transducers missing 
	
	For example, a logic network with three enzymes alchol dehydrogenase, glucose dehydrogenase and glucose oxidase operating as four concatenated logic gates and four different input signals (NADH,  actealdehyde,glucose and oxygen) The cascade of reactions resulted in ph changes. 
	successful case: yielding acid medium,lowering pH from initila ph 6-7 to approcimately 4. The pH scale is defined from 0 (acid solution) to 14 (lye solution).

	%verbindung mit transducer
	
	The lower pH value resulted in switching to ON of a electrochemical interface that functioned as transducerand and  read out by whatever, volt usw
	While 16 different variants where possible only four combinations resultet in a ON state.

This combination is a example for a multisignal processing enzyme logic system coupled with an electrochemical transduction readout of the output signal (pH change)
