\section{Introduction}
%1.Context: what problem is being solved, why relevant or interesting, benefit, possible applications
%2.innovation: described technique completely new or does it improve earlier approcahes? what is improved 
%3.thesolution: how does the presented technique work, core idea of the solution 
	\begin{itemize}
		\item common biosensing devises are based on a single input 
		\item high-fidelity compared
		\item closed loop/feedback loops possible (sense/act/treat)
		\item rapid and reliable assessment of overall physiological condition
		\item could initiate optimal timely therapeutic intervention
		\item application og biomolecular logic systems for analystic purposes could yield a novel class of biosensors: many input signals and binary outputs

\section{considerations}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Requires:interface of biocomputing systems + electronic transducer\\
		Therefore
		\item scalability (increasing nuber of logic gates)
		\item complexity(coupling of gates abd non boolean elements)
		\item composition, preparation and immobilization of the biocomputing surface layer
		\item layer by layer
		\item optimal surface confinement 
		\item careful engineering of the enzyme microenvironment(on transducer surface) for performance
		\item biocomputing layer + transducing layer + combine individual logic-gate elements	
	\end{itemize}
