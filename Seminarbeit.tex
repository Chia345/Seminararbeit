%es werden nicht biosensors kombiniert
Biocomputing has recently gained a place beneath other computing paradigms. Utilizing the natural rules of interaction between biochemical substances, new ways and techniques of solving computing problems have been developed. This review covers the concept of combining so called biosensors, devices that analyse single-input bioprocesses, with the technical possibilities of more complex biochemical logic systems. This combination, utilizing enzymes as the ''machinery'' of biochemical logic systems, aims to create complex analytical biosensors for medical application.

\subsection{Context}
s
	In the medical field biosensors (analytic devices to convert a biochemical response into an electric signal) are an essential tool for the monitoring and detection of a wide range of medical conditions. The currently available sensors work as single-input devices, that can analyse only one specific substance. New concepts aim to create devices, that can analyse multiple inputs and transform those into a single output signal. This change allows for more possible applications.\\
	
	Once realized, those biosensors could revolutionize a great number medical treatments and therapies. Through the analysis of multiple inputs, the sensors could scan specific injuries or diseases. More complex models could even create sense-act-treat devices, that immediately apply the correct treatment after a specific result of the analysis. Especially in medical emergencies, where rapid reactions are of paramount importance, these developments would mark a ground-breaking change. Even personalized medical treatment, which could autonomously adjust the treatment tailored to a patient’s needs, is imaginable.\\
	
	
	In the medical field Biosensors, analytic devices to convert a biological response into a electric signal, are a essential tool for monitoring and detection of a wide range of medical conditions from Diabetes to .....
	While common biosensing devices are limited to a single input, the novelty of Biosensors based on enzyme-based logic systems can process muliple biochemical signals. This article concentrates on the concept of the mulisignal processing Biosensors and the resulting challenges.\\
	
	The basic principle of biosensors are two layers: the receptor, that processes the inputs and the transducer, that translates the received signals to a yes/no-output. The main innovation of the new concept is to replace the current one-input receptor with a biochemical system, that allows a re-creatable analysis of multiple inputs, which are then transformed into one output. The receptor usually consists of enzymes (research also produced working systems using DNA and RNA), which react with specific substances. 
	 
	 As the result of that reaction is reliable by definition, it produces an exploitable substance, that gets transduced into a yes/no signal.
	

	This document is structures as follows. In Section 2 the concept of Biosensors with enzyme-based logic is introduced. Subsection 2.1 describes the principle of enzyme-based gates and Subsection 2.2 networks of logic gates and the combination with transducers. While section 2 only dealy with the concept of Biosensors section 3 concentrates on the designing of multisignal Biosensors for medical applications.
	In section 4 considerations. Section 5 summarize and outlook. 
	
	
	
	
	
\section{concept}

The multisignal processing biosensors in this article are based on enzyme-based logic systems, consisting of chemical logic gates mimicking Boolean operations. Like in common biosensors with single inputs the biosensor is composed by several layers. The receptor, that in common biosensors recognices the selected analyte of interest, is replaced by a enzyme logic systems
The transducer converting biological recognition interaction into a type of signal that is oberservable, for example a electrical current.wortähnlichkeit senses physical changes and converts it into an electrical signal.

\subsection{Enzyme-based logic gates and networks}	
	\subsubsection{Logic gate}	
		In Biocomputing enzyme as logic in combination with chemical inputs resulting in a end product is used to mimick Boolean logic gates such as AND and OR. To digitalize chemical processes two levels of concentrations of chemical reaction materials are considers as input signals. 0 is usually considered as the absence of a enzyme, but it can be altered. 1 equals a  significantly difference to the absence or the as 0 defined concentration.
		Output signal ein vorher bestimmter stoff, falls dieser vorhanden regel 1 falls nicth regel 0.  
	(Katz) \\
	
		Beispiel AND 
		In Fig 1 the enzymes glucose oxidase (short Gox. It catalyses the oxidation of glucose to hydrogen peroxide and D-glucono-δ-lactone and is often used for analysing free sugar in blood) and catalase( catalyzes the decomposition of hydrogen peroxide to water and oxygen) operate as the logic gate machinery. The two input signals H2O2 (Hydrogen peroxide) and glucose (blood sugar) . When both substrates present the inputs react and produc gluconic acid, which results in an optical absorbance change, that was defined as the ouput signal of the enzyme logic gate. The optical absorbance change just appeared in the presence of both inputs, mimicking the Boolean operation AND. 
		
		\begin{figure}[H] \centering \includegraphics[scale= 0.3]{pics/AND.png} \caption{Network diagramm} \label{img:and} \end{figure}
	
	
	\subsubsection{networks with electrochemical transduction}
		By assembling these single logic gates, mimicking Boolean operations,it is possible to create small logic networks(e.g. half-adder/ half subtractor)/enzyme logic systems. By adding a transducer, it is possible to convert the physical change into a electrical signal.
	
		As example a combination of different enzym-based logic gates, functioning as AND or OR. The cascade of reactions, when all four input chemicals present, result in ph changes. ph measures the degree to which a solution is acidic or alkaline. The scale is defined from 0 (acid solution) to 14 (lye solution).
		The logic network is composed of four concatenated logic gates. As logic gates the enzymes alcohol dehydrogenase(ADH, Abbau von toxischen Alkoholen ), glucose dehydrogenase( catalyst for the oxidation of glucose) and glucose oxidase VERBMISSING and four specific different input signals NADH (resulting through reduction from Nicotinamid-Adenin-Dinukleotid NAD, which is a coenzyme found in all living cells)  actealdehyde (also named ethanal and is a organic chemical compound, for example natually occuring in coffee, bread, and ripe fruit), glucose  and oxygen (O)
	 	When all inputs present the reaction yiels to a acid medium, lowering the origin pH value of the solution from initial ph-value 6-7 to approximately 4.

	%verbindung mit transducer
	
		The lower pH value resulted in switching to ON of a electrochemical interface that functioned as transducer and the electrical signal can be read out.(low voltage as 0 and MISSING as 1). While 16 different combinations of input signals where possible (present and absent) only four of these resultet in an ON state.
		\begin{figure}[H] \centering \includegraphics[scale= 0.4]{pics/ph.png} \caption{Network diagramm} \label{img:ph} \end{figure}
	
	
		This combination is a example for a multisignal processing enzyme logic system coupled with an electrochemical transduction readout of the output signal (pH change)
